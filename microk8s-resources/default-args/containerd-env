# To start containerd behind a proxy you need to add an HTTPS_PROXY
# environment variable in this file. HTTPS_PROXY is of the following form:
# HTTPS_PROXY=http://username:password@proxy:port/
# where username: and password@ are optional. eg:
#
# HTTPS_PROXY=https://squid.internal:3128
#
#
# Remember to restart the containerd daemon after editing this file:
#
# sudo systemctl restart snap.microk8s.daemon-containerd.service
