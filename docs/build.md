# Building the snap from source

[Building a snap](https://snapcraft.io/docs/snapcraft-overview) is done by running `snapcraft` on the root of the project.
A VM managed by Multipass is spawned to contain the build process. If you donâ€™t have Multipass installed,
snapcraft will first prompt for its automatic installation.

Alternatively, you can build the snap in an LXC container.
Snapcraft and LXD are needed in this case:
```
sudo snap install snapcraft --classic
sudo snap install lxd
sudo apt-get remove lxd* -y
sudo apt-get remove lxc* -y
sudo lxd init
sudo usermod -a -G lxd ${USER}
```

Build the snap with:
```
git clone http://github.com/ubuntu/microk8s
cd ./microk8s/
snapcraft --use-lxd
```

Install the newly compiled snap:
```
sudo snap install microk8s_*_amd64.snap --classic --dangerous
```

## Building a custom MicroK8s package

To produce a custom build with specific component versions we cannot use the snapcraft build process on the host OS. We need to
[prepare an LXC](https://forum.snapcraft.io/t/how-to-create-a-lxd-container-for-snap-development/4658)
container with Ubuntu 16:04 and snapcraft:
```
lxc launch ubuntu:16.04 --ephemeral test-build
lxc exec test-build -- snap install snapcraft --classic
lxc exec test-build -- apt update
lxc exec test-build -- git clone https://github.com/ubuntu/microk8s
```

We can then set the following environment variables prior to building:
 - KUBE_VERSION: kubernetes release to package. Defaults to latest stable.
 - ETCD_VERSION: version of etcd.
 - CNI_VERSION: version of CNI tools.
 - KUBE_TRACK: kubernetes release series (e.g., 1.10) to package. Defaults to latest stable.
 - ISTIO_VERSION: istio release.
 - KNATIVE_SERVING_VERSION: Knative Serving release.
 - KNATIVE_EVENTING_VERSION: Knative Eventing release.
 - RUNC_COMMIT: the commit hash from which to build runc
 - CONTAINERD_COMMIT: the commit hash from which to build containerd
 - KUBERNETES_REPOSITORY: build the kubernetes binaries from this repository instead of getting them from upstream
 - KUBERNETES_COMMIT: commit to be used from KUBERNETES_REPOSITORY for building the kubernetes banaries


For building we prepend the variables we need as well as `SNAPCRAFT_BUILD_ENVIRONMENT=host` so the current LXC container is used. For example to build the MicroK8s snap for Kubernetes v1.9.6 we:
```
lxc exec test-build -- sh -c "cd microk8s && SNAPCRAFT_BUILD_ENVIRONMENT=host KUBE_VERSION=v1.9.6 snapcraft"
```

The produced snap is inside the ephemeral LXC container, we need to copy it to the host:
```
lxc file pull test-build/root/microk8s/microk8s_v1.9.6_amd64.snap .
```

#### Installing the snap
```
snap install microk8s_latest_amd64.snap --classic --dangerous
```

## Assembling the Calico CNI manifest

The calico CNI manifest can be found under `upgrade-scripts/000-switch-to-calico/resources/calico.yaml`.
Building the manifest is subject to the upstream calico project k8s installation process.
At the time of the v3.13.2 release. The `calico.yaml` manifest is a slightly modifies version of:
`https://docs.projectcalico.org/manifests/calico.yaml`:
- CALICO_IPV4POOL_CIDR was set to "10.1.0.0/16"
- CNI_NET_DIR was set to "/var/snap/microk8s/current/args/cni-network"
- We set the following mount paths:
  1. var-run-calico to /var/snap/microk8s/current/var/run/calico
  1. var-lib-calico to /var/snap/microk8s/current/var/lib/calico
  1. cni-bin-dir to /var/snap/microk8s/current/opt/cni/bin
  1. cni-net-dir to /var/snap/microk8s/current/args/cni-network
  1. host-local-net-dir to /var/snap/microk8s/current/var/lib/cni/networks
  1. policysync to /var/snap/microk8s/current/var/run/nodeagent
- We enabled vxlan following the instructions in [the official docs.](https://docs.projectcalico.org/getting-started/kubernetes/installation/config-options#switching-from-ip-in-ip-to-vxlan)
- FELIX_LOGSEVERITYSCREEN was set to "error"
