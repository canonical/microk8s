# Building the snap from source

[Building a snap](https://snapcraft.io/docs/snapcraft-overview) is done by running `snapcraft` on the root of the project.
A VM managed by Multipass is spawned to contain the build process. If you donâ€™t have Multipass installed,
snapcraft will first prompt for its automatic installation.

Alternatively, you can build the snap in an LXC container.
LXD is needed in this case:
```
sudo snap install lxd
sudo apt-get remove lxd* -y
sudo apt-get remove lxc* -y
sudo lxd init
```

Build the snap with:
```
git clone http://github.com/ubuntu/microk8s
cd ./microk8s/
snapcraft --use-lxd
```

## Building a custom MicroK8s package

To produce a custom build with specific component versions we cannot use the snapcraft build process on the host OS. We need to
[prepare an LXC](https://forum.snapcraft.io/t/how-to-create-a-lxd-container-for-snap-development/4658)
container with Ubuntu 16:04 and snapcraft:
```
lxc launch ubuntu:16.04 --ephemeral test-build
lxc exec test-build -- snap install snapcraft --classic
lxc exec test-build -- apt update
lxc exec test-build -- git clone https://github.com/ubuntu/microk8s
```

We can then set the following environment variables prior to building:
 - KUBE_VERSION: kubernetes release to package. Defaults to latest stable.
 - ETCD_VERSION: version of etcd.
 - CNI_VERSION: version of CNI tools.
 - KUBE_TRACK: kubernetes release series (e.g., 1.10) to package. Defaults to latest stable.
 - ISTIO_VERSION: istio release.
 - KNATIVE_SERVING_VERSION: Knative Serving release.
 - KNATIVE_EVENTING_VERSION: Knative Eventing release.
 - RUNC_COMMIT: the commit hash from which to build runc
 - CONTAINERD_COMMIT: the commit hash from which to build containerd
 - KUBERNETES_REPOSITORY: build the kubernetes binaries from this repository instead of getting them from upstream
 - KUBERNETES_COMMIT: commit to be used from KUBERNETES_REPOSITORY for building the kubernetes banaries


For building we prepend the variables we need as well as `SNAPCRAFT_BUILD_ENVIRONMENT=host` so the current LXC container is used. For example to build the MicroK8s snap for Kubernetes v1.9.6 we:
```
lxc exec test-build -- sh -c "cd microk8s && SNAPCRAFT_BUILD_ENVIRONMENT=host KUBE_VERSION=v1.9.6 snapcraft"
```

The produced snap is inside the ephemeral LXC container, we need to copy it to the host:
```
lxc file pull test-build/root/microk8s/microk8s_v1.9.6_amd64.snap .
```

#### Installing the snap
```
snap install microk8s_latest_amd64.snap --classic --dangerous
```
